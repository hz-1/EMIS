## Requirements
The codes is tested on 
- Python 3.8.19
- PyTorch 1.13.1+cu116
- Nvidia GPU (RTX 3090) with CUDA version 11.6
1. First run ```pip install -U -r requirements.txt```
2. Download the checkpoints of the ViT model for SAM and put it under ```./checkpoints```
- ```vit_b(default)```: [ViT-B SAM model](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth)
- ```vit_l```: [ViT-L SAM model](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_l_0b3195.pth)
- ```vit_h```: [ViT-H SAM model](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth)

## Quick Start
1. Put your image to the floder your_data 
2. To get the mask results: run ```python run.py```
3. Under the output folder, check the binary mask generated by your image and the bounding box coordinates corresponding to each object in the mask.
